A simple grocery shopping list, stage 1

Create a web page that will display a shopping list.

Create a simple project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In your index.js create an array of grocery items to buy such as apples, bananas, milk, bread etc. The items are just simple strings
In your HTML create a div with id and class list
Use a for each loop to go through the array of grocery items and create its HTML representation such as this.
<div class="item">Apples</div>
<div class="item">Bananas</div>
<!-- other items... -->
Set this content is innerHTML of the #list element.

Shopping list, stage 2
We would like our shopping list to have not only the item names but also how many or how much of each item we want to buy.

Change the items in the array from a simple string to an object, which will contain the name of the item and the amount as well.
Change your page so that it displays the name and amount

Put a form on your page for adding new items to the list.
